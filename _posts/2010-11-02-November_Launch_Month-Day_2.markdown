title: November Launch Month - Day 2
layout: post
---

Not that much to report today. With a midterm to study for and a problem set to complete, I didn't have much time to work on my app. I have however, set a schedule by which I want to follow.

* Nov 1  - Nov 7:  Design app and become familiar with Android
* Nov 8  - Nov 21: Code like a maniac to create my MVP (minimal viable product)
* Nov 22 - Nov 27: Beta test my app and iterate upon feedback. Prepare for launch.
* Nov 28: Launch.

As a side note, if you're interested in learning Linear Algebra and are looking for resources to learn from, I highly recommend the [MIT OpenCourseWare course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm "MIT OpenCourseWare course") and Khan Academy's [Linear Algebra](http://www.khanacademy.org/#Linear%20Algebra) videos. They have been very useful studying for my linear algebra midterm.

See you tomorrow.
