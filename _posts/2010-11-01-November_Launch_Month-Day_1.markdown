## November Launch Month - Day 1

I am going to launch an Android application as part of [November Launch Month.](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1773398 "November Launch Month")

Today, I spent the day deliberating over what I want my app to do, and gathering the resources that I'll need for this month-long sprint (books, software, caffeine, etc.). I'm using [The Android Developer's Cookbook: Building Applications with the Android SDK](http://www.amazon.com/Android-Developers-Cookbook-Building-Applications/dp/0321741234 "The Android Developer's Cookbook: Building Applications with the Android SDK") and [The Developer's Guide](http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html "The Developer's Guide") to get me going with Android quickly.

I've decided that I'm going to create a virtual personal assistant app. This personal assistant will help you schedule events, keep track of what you need to get done, and encourage you to **get it done.**  I don't have all the details fleshed out at this point, but I'll have more about this later.

I also signed up for [21times.](http://hn.21times.org) 21times send out a daily email with a useful article to read, and 3 links that allow you to keep track of your progress. It's still in development, but it looks like it will be a useful service. It will be a constant reminder of what I am trying to accomplish, and how well I am doing. I expect that I will have days when I won't be able to work on my app due to school and life in general, but if I can make a little progress each day, I should be in good shape by the end of November.

I plan to keep this blog updated as a way of holding myself accountable for this project, and as a way of reflecting on what I have accomplished each day.

See you tomorrow.
